            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>My name is Sathvika Muktha, sophomore at UNC, Charlotte. I have started dancing since I was 8 years old. Apart from dancing, playing badminton, running and photography are my other hobbies.</p>
            <h3>My Backgound in Dance:</h3>
            <p>I have dedicated myself to the art of Dancing for several years now. I have learnt a classical form of dance called Bharatanatyam while I was living in India. Besides Bharathnatyam, I also enjoy exploring other styles like Bollywood, Contemporary, hip-hop and ballet.</p>
