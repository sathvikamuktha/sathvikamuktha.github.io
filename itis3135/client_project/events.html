    <h3>TSO Events on Hold Until Next Semester</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Dear TSO members and friends,</strong> As the current semester draws to a close, we want to inform you that the Tamil Student Organization (TSO) will not be conducting any further events until the start of the next semester(August).</p>
      
      <p>We had an incredible time this semester, celebrating our rich Tamil culture, language, and traditions through various engaging activities, events, and initiatives. From vibrant cultural performances to insightful literary discussions and language classes, we cherished every moment spent together as a community.</p>
      
      <p>However, it's now time for a well-deserved break. We encourage all our members to focus on their academic commitments and enjoy the upcoming holiday season with their loved ones. Rest assured, the TSO executive team will be hard at work during the break, planning an exciting lineup of events and activities for the next semester. We promise to come back stronger than ever, with even more opportunities to explore, celebrate, and embrace our Tamil heritage.</p>

      <p>Keep an eye on our website and social media channels for updates and announcements regarding our plans for the upcoming semester. We look forward to welcoming you back and continuing our journey.
      </p>
    <h2>Come back soon!</h2>
