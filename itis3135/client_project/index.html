      <li>The Tamil Student Organization at UNC Charlotte tirelessly works to represent and promote the rich Tamil language, culture, and history. We achieve this through a variety of ways, creating a vibrant community that celebrates our shared heritage and invites others to learn from it.</li>
      <li>We organize cultural events which showcase Tamil traditions and customs. These events serve as a platform for members to engage with their roots while also introducing Tamil culture to the wider community.</li>
      <li>A key focus of our organization is the discussion and exploration of Tamil literature. We believe that literature is an essential part of any culture, offering profound insights into our heritage and values. We also conduct Tamil language classes for anyone interested in learning this classical language. We believe that language is the key to understanding any culture, and we strive to make Tamil accessible to all.</li>
      <li>For entertainment and bonding, we hold Tamil movie nights and karaoke sessions. These events are a fun way to explore contemporary Tamil culture while also fostering a tight-knit community.</li>
      <li>Our organization is open to any Tamil speaking individuals from India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, and beyond. Moreover, anyone with an interest in learning about Tamil culture, regardless of their ethnic background, is more than welcome to join. We are a diverse group united by our love for Tamil culture, and we can't wait to welcome you into our community.</li>
